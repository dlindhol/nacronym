# nacronym
A [`nacronym`](https://www.urbandictionary.com/define.php?term=nacronym) is a name that was formerly an acronym. The intent of this term is to describe names that remain after purposely shedding the original semantics of the spelled-out acronym. This concept is also known as an `orphan initialism` (categorized under [`Pseudo-acronyms`](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Acronym#Pseudo-acronyms) by Wikipedia where they also use the term `non-acronymous`). The distinction between an initialism and an acronym is that an acronym is generally pronounced as a word as apposed to pronouncing each letter. Thus, the term `nacronym` is a special case of `orphan initialism` for an acronym that was pronounced as a word and is now effectively a proper name that transcends its original meaning.
